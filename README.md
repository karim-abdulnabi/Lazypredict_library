# Lazypredict_library

Are you calling fit and predict on multiple models over and over again?

ðŸ‘‰ Try lazypredict!

It's a Python package that automates the ML modeling process. It works on both regression and classification tasks. It outputs metrics like accuracy, ROC AUC, F1 Score (and more!)

I like it because its syntax is pretty much identical to scikit-learn, making it easy to plug-and-play from existing code.

It's easy â€“ just see the screenshot below as proof!

Some word of caution:
ðŸ”Ž limited hyperparameter tuning.
ðŸ”Ž sparse documentation.
ðŸ”Ž hidden preprocessing steps.

how can you install ?
